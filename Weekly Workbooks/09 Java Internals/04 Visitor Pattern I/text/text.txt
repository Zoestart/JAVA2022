Concepts: abstract classes,  multiple dynamic dispatch, overriding, operation decoupling, Visitor pattern, class diagram basics

The Visitor Pattern facilitates the addition of new operations to existing object structures without modifying those structures (maybe look up open closed principle). A visitor class is created that implements all of the appropriate specializations. The visitor takes the instance reference as input, and implements the goal through double dispatch.
